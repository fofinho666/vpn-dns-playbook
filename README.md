- After running the playbook set this server as the default DNS server of your NAT router
- Go to AdGuard and choose/add your DNS blocklists

## Two-factor authentication email
When setting up the 2fa for the first time. Authelia will inform you that it set you an email.   
This email will not be sent since there's no SMTP server :( 

To see this email. SSH into your VPN server and enter: `show_2fa`

## Debug
### Logs
Most of this runs on docker containers, to see the logs of them run: `sudo docker logs -f <container name>` .  
The container names are:
- BunkerWeb -> `bunkerweb`
- Authelia -> `authelia`
- AdGuardHome -> `adguard-unbound`
- WireGuard -> `wg-easy`     
- Portainer -> `portainer`
- Homer Dashboard -> `homer`
